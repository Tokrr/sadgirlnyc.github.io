30 Days of Code

Inspired by Jennifer Dewalt's 180 websites in 180 days and Jessica Eldredge's 100 days of Javascript project.

The Rules

    1. I will do 30 small coding projects ranging in different JS frameworks.
    2. There's no time limit on how long an individual exercise can take.
    3. Perfect is the enemy of good. I will not be afraid of making mistakes.
    4. I will ask for help when I need it.
